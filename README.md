### **Solar-Tracking Devices – Detailed Explanation**

A **solar-tracking device** is a mechanical system designed to **orient solar panels towards the sun** continuously throughout the day. Unlike fixed solar panels that remain at a set angle, trackers adjust dynamically to follow the sun’s movement from **east to west** and sometimes adjust for seasonal changes as well.

#### **1. Purpose**

* The main goal is to **maximize sunlight exposure**, ensuring that the solar panels are always at an optimal angle to the sun’s rays.
* This increases the **energy output (kWh)** significantly compared to fixed-tilt systems.

---

#### **2. Types of Solar Trackers**

✅ **Single-Axis Trackers**

* Rotate on **one axis** – usually aligned **north-south**, allowing panels to follow the sun’s path from **east to west**.
* Common in **utility-scale solar farms** due to cost-effectiveness and decent efficiency improvement (\~25-35% increase over fixed panels).

✅ **Dual-Axis Trackers**

* Move along **two axes** – both **horizontal and vertical**.
* Adjust for both **daily east-west movement and seasonal changes in sun’s elevation angle**.
* Provides **maximum energy yield** (\~35-45% increase) but is more complex and expensive, used in specialized applications or areas with limited space requiring maximum efficiency.

---

#### **3. Working Principle**

* Uses **motors, actuators, sensors, and controllers** to detect the sun’s position and adjust the panel orientation automatically.
* Some systems use **astronomical algorithms** (calculating sun’s position based on time, date, and location) while others use **light sensors** to track sunlight directly.

---

#### **4. Applications**

* **Residential rooftops**: Less common due to higher cost and maintenance complexity.
* **Commercial installations**: Where land is scarce, maximizing output per unit area justifies the investment.
* **Utility-scale solar farms**: Widely used to increase overall energy generation and project profitability.

---

#### **5. Advantages**

* **Increased energy generation** (up to 45% more depending on tracker type and location).
* Better performance during **morning and evening hours** when sun angles are low.

---

#### **6. Disadvantages**

* **Higher initial cost** due to mechanical and control systems.
* **Maintenance requirements** are greater due to moving parts.
* **Structural considerations**: Increased wind loading risks, needing stronger foundations.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**

Solar tracking systems play a crucial role in improving the **efficiency of solar PV systems**. While **fixed panels are simpler and cheaper**, trackers are preferred in projects aiming for **maximum energy yield and better return on investment (ROI)**, especially in regions with high direct normal irradiance (DNI).
